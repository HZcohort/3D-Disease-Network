# **Disease clusters and their genetic determinants following a diagnosis of depression: analyses based on a novel three-dimensional disease network approach**

## Overview

In this study, we developed a novel three-dimensional network approach that integrates and refines existing disease trajectory and comorbidity network analysis methods. This new approach enhances disease association verification by incorporating regularized partial correlations. It also facilitates robust identification and visualization of disease clusters (i.e., groups of depression-associated diseases with high within-group connectivity) through both non-temporal (illustrated by the x-axis and y-axis) and temporal (z-axis) dimensions.

## Visualization

The interactive 3D disease network following a diagnosis of depression can be visualized [here](https://hzcohort.github.io/3D-Disease-Network/full_plot.html). Or you can download the [html file](https://github.com/HZcohort/3D-Disease-Network/blob/main/full_plot.html) to view locally.

## GWAS summary data

GWAS summary data for the identified post-depression disease clusters are available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/15380732

## Code Availability

The python codes for conducting the disease network analysis is available in the "[py_code](https://github.com/HZcohort/3D-Disease-Network/tree/main/py_code)" folder, using our newly developed Python package **DiseaseNetPy**, which will be released here: https://github.com/HZcohort/DiseaseNetPy.

The python codes in the folder "[py_code_v1_deprecated](https://github.com/HZcohort/3D-Disease-Network/tree/main/py_code_v1_deprecated)" is for the initial version of the analysis, which has been deprecated.
