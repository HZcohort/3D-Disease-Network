# **Disease clusters and their genetic determinants following a diagnosis of depression: analyses based on a novel three-dimensional disease network approach**

## Overview

In this study, we developed a novel three-dimensional network approach that integrates and refines existing disease trajectory and comorbidity network analysis methods. This new approach enhances disease association verification by incorporating regularized partial correlations. It also facilitates robust identification and visualization of disease clusters (i.e., groups of depression-associated diseases with high within-group connectivity) through both non-temporal (illustrated by the x-axis and y-axis) and temporal (z-axis) dimensions.

## Visualization

The interactive 3D disease network following a diagnosis of depression can be visualized [here](https://hzcohort.github.io/3D-Disease-Network/full_plot.html). Or you can download the the [html file](https://github.com/HZcohort/3D-Disease-Network/blob/main/full_plot.html) to view locally.

## Code Availability	

The Python code for performing the 3D disease network analysis using large-scale healthcare data will be added later.
