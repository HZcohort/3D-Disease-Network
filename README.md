# **Disease clusters and their genetic determinants following a diagnosis of depression: analyses based on a novel three-dimensional disease network approach**

In this study, we developed a novel three-dimensional network approach which refines disease association verification by incorporating regularized partial correlations, and facilitates robust identification and visualization of disease clusters (i.e., groups of depression-associated diseases with high within-group connectivity) through both non-temporal (illustrating by x-axis and y-axis) and temporal (by z-axis) dimensions.

The interactive 3D disease network after a diagnosis of depression can be visulized in: https://hzcohort.github.io/3D-Disease-Network/full_plot.html

The python code for doing the 3D disease network analysis using large-scale health care data will be added later.
